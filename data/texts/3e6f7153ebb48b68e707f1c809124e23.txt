Read more Helpful Report DeVv Gupta 4.0 out of 5 stars Good Value for Money with Minor Issues Reviewed in India on 16 April 2025 Colour: Carbon Black Style Name: Bassheads 900 Pattern Name: Headphones Verified Purchase bought the Boat Bassheads 900 for ₹700, and overall, it's worth the price. The sound quality is impressive for the price range, and it's lightweight and comfortable to wear. However, it seems to be slightly less compatible with Moto mobile phones — sometimes the audio cuts off in one ear. If you're lying on the bed and change sides, even a small jerk to the wired connection can cause both sides to lose audio, and the sound switches to the loudspeaker. The material quality is decent, but it should be handled with care — it's not meant for rough use or frequent drops. Overall, it's a good headphone for the price. If you're looking for a budget-friendly option, this is one of the best in its category.

Images in this review 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report Alapsingh Chouhan 5.0 out of 5 stars Definately a 5star headphone Reviewed in India on 21 March 2025 Colour: Carbon Black Style Name: Bassheads 900 Pattern Name: Headphones Verified Purchase So, for anyone wondering whether these headphones are good or not, this review will clear your confusion. Sound Quality (5 Stars) The sound quality of these headphones is excellent—perfect for any purpose. If you’re a music lover, you can definitely go for them. Size, Weight, and Durability (4.5 Stars) They are very lightweight and smaller in size compared to other headphones, making them perfect for music lovers. However, don’t expect them to be very durable if dropped, as the body is somewhat fragile. Gaming (4.5 Stars) The headphones are great for gaming, with clear sound for footsteps and other in-game audio details. The only reason I’m giving 4.5 stars instead of 5 is due to the microphone issue. However, you can get the flexible mic variant, which solves this problem. Comfort (4.5 Stars) Initially, they might feel a bit stiff, but as they loosen up over time, they become much more comfortable. You can use them for 2–3 hours at first, and once you're used to them, 3–4 hours comfortably. If needed, you can take a 5-minute break and continue using them for another 3–4 hours. Overall (Considering the Price Range) For music lovers: Definitely 5 stars. For gamers: With the flexible mic variant, it's 5 stars as well. If you already have an external mic for your PC or phone, the normal variant will work just fine. This is one of the best headphones available in the ₹1000 price range. I’ve tried many others, but overall, this is the best one.

I have to say, these are some of the best headphones you can get at this price point. USB headphones are usually quite expensive, but these are surprisingly affordable without compromising on quality. The build quality is solid, with a nice finish that feels durable. They fit comfortably and block out outside noise pretty well, which makes for a great listening experience. The sound quality is impressive too—clear audio with good bass, and I didn’t notice any distortion even at higher volumes. If you’re on a budget and looking for good branded USB headphones under ₹1000, I highly recommend these. Totally worth it!

Reviewed in India on 21 March 2025 Colour: Black w/ USB Type A Style Name: With USB Pattern Name: Headphones Verified Purchase I do not feel that this is compatible with mobile phones. Even if a converter plug is used, it doesn't function. Good for Laptop and other systems. Music quality; I would put at 6/10. That's all. Ok, the clarity is good, but don't overestimate. Fair enough, for a medium quality sound reception.

The sound quality is excellent, with clear audio and strong bass that enhances the listening experience. The microphone works well for calls and gaming, delivering crisp and noise-free voice transmission. The build quality is sturdy, and the ear cushions are comfortable for extended use.

Reviewed in the United Arab Emirates on 30 October 2023 Colour: Carbon Black Style Name: Bassheads 900 Pattern Name: Headphones Verified Purchase Actually I bought this for my official PC where Bluetooth is not compatible. This is having 3.5 mm jack which is compatible for mobile phones, laptops & PCs. Considering the price, very good sound quality. Only disadvantage I observed is that microphone is on wire itself, so that we need to hold it near our mouth while talking.

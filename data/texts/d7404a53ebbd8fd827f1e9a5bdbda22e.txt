Bought the Samsung Galaxy A16 for my brother, and overall, it’s a good phone for its price range. Below are few things to look up if you are going to buy this phone. - Battery life is decent. It will last full day for usual purpose, but if you're going to play some games (like BGMI or Fortnite) it will last upto 6hrs. - The speed and overall performance are impressive for a phone in this budget. Apps run smoothly, and there’s no noticeable lag during daily tasks or light gaming. - The Camera quality is good for everyday photos. - The curved design gives a good grip, which is a nice touch. The only drawback for me will be the lack of an earphone jack. For a phone priced under ₹20k, I feel they should have included it. It’s a small inconvenience, especially if you’re someone who prefers wired earphones.

Sripad 5.0 out of 5 stars Samsung A16 5G- 6GB-RAM 128GB-NVM Reviewed in India on 21 December 2024 Colour: Light Green | 6GB + 128GB Size: 6GB + 128GB Style Name: With exchange bonus or No cost EMI Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. I am writing these ratings after 8 days of Usage. Here is my detailed review about this phone. Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear. Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone. Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range. Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC. Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities. OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements. Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day. Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish. Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well. Anomalies: None so far. Did not see the phone over heating issue. Samsung has produced a quality product. I would definitely recommend this. It’s a good buy.

After two weeks of use, its Performance, Storage, and Camera are okay, as per my requirements. Got a better recharge cycle time long-term performance. Android 14 is running.

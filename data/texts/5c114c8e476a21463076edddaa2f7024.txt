## ToDoListApp: A Modern Android To-Do List Application

This project, available on GitHub at [garg-lucifer/ToDoListApp](https://github.com/garg-lucifer/ToDoListApp), is a To-Do List application built using Kotlin and following modern Android development practices.  It showcases a clean architecture and utilizes several popular libraries and design patterns.

**Key Features:**

*   **Built with Kotlin:** Leverages the benefits of Kotlin for concise and safe code.
*   **Material 3 Design:** Provides a modern and visually appealing user interface.
*   **MVVM Architecture:**  Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
*   **Data Binding:** Simplifies UI updates and reduces boilerplate code.
*   **Navigation Component:** Uses the Android Navigation Component for managing in-app navigation with a single-activity, multi-fragment approach.
*   **Room Persistence Library:** Provides a robust and efficient way to manage local data storage.
*   **Kotlin Coroutines:** Utilizes Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous operations, improving performance and responsiveness.
*   **LiveData:**  Employs LiveData for reactive data streams, ensuring UI updates when data changes.
*   **Dagger Hilt:**  Uses Hilt for dependency injection, promoting modularity and testability.
*   **Notifications:** Implements notifications to remind users of tasks.

**Tech Stack & Open-Source Libraries:**

*   **Minimum SDK Level:** 26
*   **Kotlin:**  The primary programming language.
*   **Lifecycle:**  Handles UI state changes based on the Android Activity lifecycle.
*   **ViewModel:** Manages UI-related data and survives configuration changes.
*   **DataBinding:** Connects UI components to data sources declaratively.
*   **Room:**  Abstraction layer over SQLite for database access.
*   **Navigation Component Graphs:** Single-activity multiple-fragment architecture.
*   **Hilt:** Dependency injection.
*   **Coroutines:** Asynchronous programming.
*   **Material-Components:** Ripple animation and CardView.
*   **ColorPicker:** Color selection UI element.

**Architecture:**

The application follows the recommended MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture in conjunction with the Repository pattern. This promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the application easier to test, maintain, and scale.

*   **View:** The UI layer (Activities/Fragments) responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions. Uses Data Binding to observe the data.
*   **ViewModel:**  Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, preparing and exposing data for the View to consume.
*   **Model:** Represents the data layer, typically involving data sources like Room database.
*   **Repository:** Mediates between different data sources (local database, remote API), providing a clean API for data access to the ViewModel.
